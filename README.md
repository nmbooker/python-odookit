# python-odookit [WIP] A more modern and better designed oekit, for Python 3

Compared to https://github.com/nmbooker/oekit, I'm aiming for:
* a more modular design for developers using it as a library,
* newer 'odoo' naming,
* a more consistent naming convention for scripts; and
* Python 3 support

Should it be necesarry I will write an extra 'python-odookit-compat-scripts' library for optional compatibility with existing script callers.
